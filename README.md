## Overview

Pairing challenge at Makers Academy to build a command line application that emulates the functionality of an oyster-card. This application was built using specific user requirements with Ruby and implements a TDD approach whilst covering multiple edge cases.

A user is able to create a new oyster-card, and initiate stations with zones to travel between. Before a user can travel, they must top up their new oyster. A user can then touch in and out of stations. When a journey is completed the user is charged accordingly by the zones they have travelled between and the journey is stored in a log for the user to view.  

## How to use

Oyster-card runs directly from the command line, install either by cloning or forking the repository. Change directory to the root folder and run bundle install.

```
$ bundle install
```
Open irb, and enter the following to run the application.

```
$ require './lib/dockingstation.rb'
 => true
```
To run the tests for the application, run RSpec.

```
$ rspec
```

## Scope

**Oyster-card** (*Oystercard.new*)
- Oyster can be topped up to the maximum value
- Oyster can be used to touch in and out of stations.
- Can not touch in without having a minimum balance.  
- Calculates the fare for a journey taken.
- Charges a fixed penalty fee for incomplete journeys

**Station** (*Station.new("kings_cross", 2)*)
- A new station must be created with a name and a zone.

**Journey**
- Stores a hash with the entry station(touch in) and exit station(touch out).

**JourneyLog**
- Creates a new Journey instance.
- Logs the taken journey.
